# Caracal

/!\ This project is in alpha stage with limited parts testing which are subject to change, please make sure to report any problems in  https://github.com/suslemon/Caracal/issues/1 

A Voron V0 inspired minimalist and modular CoreXY 3D printer focused on ease of parts sourcing, reduced number of fasterner types, self-printable parts and fast and simple assembly. It is also tweaked to accept spare/salvaged parts from another printer like an Ender 3 to further minimise costs. 

While not optimised for speed benchys in its stock form, Caracal was designed with modding in mind so that requirements for speed printing could be met with minimal effort. 

Not counting the corner brackets (which are unecessary if the frame is built using blind joints), all sides of the printer are flush to facilitate addition of side panels for enclosed builds.

Still very WIP, STLs subject to change

I printed all my parts with 0.3mm layer height, 0.5mm walls, 4 walls, 4 tops/bottoms, 30% infill (cubic) in eSun ABS+ (should be perfectly fine in PLA for non-enclosed builds)
